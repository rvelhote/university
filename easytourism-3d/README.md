# easytourism-3d
This project is from way back in 2008/2009 and it's an OpenGL 3D Application that allows users to visit landmarks of whatever fictional city you create. It contains a companion application to generate maps and a Web Service layer to provide that information to any application that want to use it.

I am very proud of this project. It's the first and only project I have created with OpenGL. It's funny to see how I did things 6 years ago and how I do them now; how much I evolved just in 6 years. Makes me wonder how I will be in 6 more :)
