# flex-bison-gpx
I found a lost folder with projects from my university days and I am uploading it to the Internet. This project is from way back in 2008/2009.

This project was for Programming Languages class. As I remember it we had to create a context-free grammar to parse a .gpx file format (containing XML), display information about the file and make some calculations.

This project was done in C, Flex and Bison.

The most important files are:
- gpx.l
- gpx.y
- lista.c
- lista.h
- token_struct.h
 
Akk the other are generated files from Flex and Bison
